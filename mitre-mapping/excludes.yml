# We need to review the following: 

get rid of the blacklist.yml, and please ignore all files from /workspaces/goldenanchor/Content_Search/Splunk/WrenchSearche and there are some alerts that show in shadow, according to the AlertStatus.csv but are showing "YES" in the the final output.

ANY search that is NOT in the AlertStatusReport.csv should be a NO as well as ANY search that is in "SHADOW" in the alert report. 

Also, please output another column on the very end that shows the directory where the alert was grabbed from.

Please make the "ignore files" faily modular so that I might add future directories to the exclude list. Again, the endpoint here is to compare the AlertStatusReport.csv with a global source of truth, and output the total number of TTPs found in TTP_Coverage that are LIVE in the AlertStatusReport.
